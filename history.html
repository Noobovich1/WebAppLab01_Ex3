                <h3>Construction and Glory (1802 - 1945)</h3>
                <p>Construction of the Imperial City began in 1804 under the orders of Emperor Gia Long, the founder of the Nguyen Dynasty. Thousands of workers were conscripted to build the massive 10-kilometer wall and the moat surrounding the city. For 143 years, it served as the political, cultural, and religious center of Vietnam.</p>

                <h3>The Forbidden Purple City</h3>
                <p>Nested inside the Imperial City is the Forbidden Purple City (Tử Cấm Thành). Modeled loosely after Beijing's Forbidden City, this area was strictly reserved for the Emperor, his concubines, and close family. Unauthorized entry by commoners or even mandarins was punishable by death.</p>

                <h3>War and Restoration</h3>
                <p>The Citadel suffered heavy damage during the 20th century, particularly during the Battle of Hue in the 1968 Tet Offensive. Out of the original 160 buildings, only a fraction survived intact. Today, extensive restoration projects are underway, supported by UNESCO, to bring this magnificent site back to its former glory.</p>
