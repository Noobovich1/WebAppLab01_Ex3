                <h3>Construction and Glory (1802 - 1945)</h3>
                <p class="drop-cap">The construction of the Imperial City began in 1804 under the command of Emperor Gia Long, the founder of the Nguyen Dynasty. After unifying the country in 1802, he chose Hue as the capital and ordered the building of a grand citadel to symbolize the strength and legitimacy of the new dynasty. The design was influenced by boThousands of workers, soldiers, and craftsmen were mobilized to construct the massive complex. The outer wall stretched nearly 10 kilometers in circumference, surrounded by a wide moat and reinforced with bastions and watchtowers. The construction required enormous quantities of stone, bricks, timber, and soil, transported from various regions of the country. The project lasted for decades, with successive emperors continuing to expand and refine the structures. For 143 years (1802–1945), the Imperial City served as the political, cultural, and religious heart of Vietnam. It was the seat of the Nguyen emperors, where important ceremonies, royal examinations, diplomatic receptions, and national rituals were held. Within its walls were palaces, temples, gardens, libraries, and administrative buildings that reflected the power and sophistication of the dynasty.</p>

                <h3>The Forbidden Purple City</h3>
                <p>At the very center of the Imperial City lay the Forbidden Purple City (Cấm Cung), the most sacred and restricted area of the complex. This inner enclosure was reserved exclusively for the emperor, the empress, royal concubines, and close members of the imperial family. Entry into this area was strictly controlled. Even high-ranking mandarins and officials were not allowed to enter without direct permission. Unauthorized access was considered a serious crime and could result in severe punishment, including death. The Forbidden Purple City contained the emperor’s living quarters, private halls, royal libraries, and spaces for personal ceremonies. It represented absolute imperial authority and the separation between the ruler and the common people.</p>

                <h3>War and Restoration</h3>
                <p>The Citadel endured significant destruction during the 20th century. The most devastating damage occurred during the Battle of Hue in 1968, part of the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. Intense fighting between opposing forces led to heavy bombardment, fires, and structural collapse throughout the complex. Out of the original 160 buildings within the Imperial City and Forbidden Purple City, only a limited number survived intact. Many priceless artifacts, wooden structures, and historical records were lost or severely damaged. After the war, preservation became a national priority. In 1993, the Complex of Hue Monuments was recognized by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage Site. Since then, extensive restoration and conservation projects have been carried out with international support. Experts have worked to reconstruct palaces, reinforce walls, restore decorative elements, and preserve remaining architectural details. Today, the Imperial City stands not only as a symbol of Vietnam’s royal past but also as a testament to resilience and cultural preservation. Although time and war left deep scars, ongoing restoration efforts continue to revive its former grandeur, allowing future generations to experience this remarkable chapter of Vietnamese history.</p>
